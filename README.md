# BASIC Code Transpiler
This web application was developed in 2015 and converts from the BASIC programming language into executable JavaScript. The programming language is derived from [miSoft Basic!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/basic/id362411238) (some apps from the forgotten http://appball.com/basic back in 2011 can be found [here](miSoft%20Basic!%20Files)). The application stores all code/files into LocalStorage, pressing "Run" will also backup the current code into LocalStorage.
