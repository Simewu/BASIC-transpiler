# BASIC Code Transpiler
This web application transpiles from the BASIC programming language into executable JavaScript. The programming language is derived from [miSoft Basic!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/basic/id362411238) (some apps from the forgotton http://appball.com/basic back in 2011 can be found [here](Misoft%20Basic!%20Scripts)). The application stores all code/files into LocalStorage, pressing "Run" will also backup the current code into LocalStorage.
